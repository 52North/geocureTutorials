# Tutorials for using geocure

The tutorials have been developed within the
[COLABIS](https://colabis.de/) project in order
to lower the hurdle to use [goecure](https://github.com/52North/geocure) from [52°North](http://52north.org/).

The tutorials are available on the 52°North GitHub Pages: https://52north.github.io/geocureTutorials/
